# Week 6 practice assessment

## What are we building?

We are building a webapp where people can have their own space and post stories in it. It is called `Cool story bro`. It has multiple pages

- Signup & Login pages (already implemented in the starter kit)
- A home page with a list of spaces of different users
- A detail page for a space where you can view a users' stories
- A page where you can view your own space and stories
- A form where you can edit your space
- A form where you can post a story

## Templates

As a starting point, you must use the following react-redux & express templates where the login / signup flow has already been implemented.

Instructions on how to use the templates can be found on the repositories themselves:

- [Frontend starter](https://github.com/Codaisseur/react-redux-template)
- [Backend starter](https://github.com/Codaisseur/new-express-template)

## Wireframe

You will be provided with a wireframe that shows an overview of the app along with this README.

## Database Entities

### Space

| key             | data type | required | notes                                                               |
